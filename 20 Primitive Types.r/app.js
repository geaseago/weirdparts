//  BIG WORD: DYNAMIC TYPING
//  js variables are dynamically typed. Meaning you don't set the type of variable. js does it for 
//    you at runtime based on what data you are putting in.

//  BIG WORD: PRIMITIVE TYPES
//  A type of data that represents a single value.
//  So, not an object, which is, as we know, a set of name/value pairs.

//  THE PRIMITIVES 
//    UNDEFINED 
//      represents a lack of existence.
//      it's what js assigns variables when they are instantiated and before they have a value.
//    NULL (all lower case)
//      also a lack of existence. 
//      but, it's the one you can use to assign to a variable. 
//    BOOLEAN  
//      true or false
//    NUMBER
//      only one numeric type in js, it's floating point.
//      no integers, decimal, etc.
//      makes math weird sometimes.
//
//    STRING
//      standard stuff
//
//    SYMBOL
//      new is javascript 6. (ES6)
//      not fully accepted in all browsers.
